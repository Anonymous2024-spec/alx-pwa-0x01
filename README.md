# ProWeb Pulse: Mastering PWA Fundamentals

## 📌 Project Overview
This project extends the **Cine Seek** movie browsing application into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using **Next.js** and the `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` package.  
The goal is to implement offline capabilities, installability, and enhanced performance while preserving the core movie discovery features.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Understand **PWA fundamentals** and their benefits
- Implement **service workers** in a Next.js application
- Configure **web app manifests** for mobile installability
- Set up proper **caching strategies** for offline performance
- Deploy and test **PWA functionality** in production

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA):** Web applications that deliver native app-like experiences
- **Service Workers:** Background JavaScript processes enabling offline use and caching
- **Web App Manifest:** JSON metadata file that powers installation prompts
- **Cache Strategies:** Techniques for storing and serving assets offline
- **Install Prompt:** Browser mechanism that allows users to add the app to their home screen

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

Transforming **Cine Seek** into a PWA highlights how media streaming and browsing apps can benefit from PWA technologies:

- **Offline Access:** View previously loaded movie details without internet
- **Performance Boost:** Assets are cached, enabling faster reloads
- **Installability:** Users can install the app to their home screen like a native app
- **Cross-Platform:** Works across desktop, Android, and iOS (via browsers) with one codebase
- **Discoverability:** PWAs can appear in search results and be packaged for app stores

This mirrors strategies used by platforms like **Netflix**, **Disney+**, and **Spotify Lite**, which leverage PWA tech to provide lightweight, app-like experiences without requiring app store downloads.
